<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Location Data</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The app captures the device’s location, even when in the background AND the long range radio is connected.

Only team members who have exchanged keys with you can decrypt the data.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Your data is only ever transmitted over the long range radio, and is encrypted with 256-bit ECC encryption.
